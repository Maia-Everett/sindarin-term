elvish (sindarin) date printing for the elvish shell

As of now this just some code, you can put in your rc.elv or somewhere equivalent, to get a function `date-elv "format"` which works almost like regular old `date +"format"`. Pull requests are welcome. I also hope I didn't make any mistakes that makes some Tolkien nerds too upset. Anyway, have fun with this.
