# sindarin-term
elvish stuff for the bash terminal

As of now this just some code you can put in your .bashrc or somewhere equivalent to get the date printed wih Sindarin weekday and Month names. I might come up with more related stuff in the future. Feel free to contribute to make it a bit prettier. I also hope I didn't make any mistakes that makes some Tolkien nerds too upset. Anyway, have fun with this.
